		<p class="prayers">My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the Blessed Sacrament. I love You above all things and I desire You in my soul. Since I cannot now receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there and unite myself wholly to You; never permit me to be separated from You.</p>
